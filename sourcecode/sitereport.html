<h2 class="srh3">My Experience...</h2>
<p class="srh3">So far I've really enjoyed making websites, and being able to learn more along the way. Since the start of college back in 2016 I had an amazing opportunity to learn so much about websites and the work that is needed to have a full functional website.
Many times before I would attempt to make my own website but something along the way would stop me from progressing further onto it, and so I would stop the project and go back to it every so often. Now during my first term at UoN so much of that has changed, as I've
been able to make a website with the layout I understand.</p>
<p class="srh3">This is probably one of the best units I've done so far whilst being at UoN. I think being able to create something about yourself with multiple languages has been such a great experience, and I can not wait for me!</p>

<h2 class="srh3">Positives</h2>
<p class="srh3">Everything about websites has been one of the best things I've learn't. It's something about websites that I latch onto when it comes to creating them. Understanding what's going on and where everything is has also been one
of those things that I've enjoyed. One of the things that was a first for me was creating more than one style sheet and having different versions based on size screen. Another thing that was a great help was a website called w3schools which provides all the help and
customisation to run a good website. </p>
</div>

<h2 class="srh3">Negatives</h2>
<p class="srh3" style="padding-bottom:50px;">I don't really have much to say than to make sure I prepare myself with more planning, and try to keep up-to-date with the progression of the website as I go along. Next time I want to make sure I have a more detailed report with time stamps as
this would be a really good way of showing the level of progression through out the term and after.</p>
